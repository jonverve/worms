            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the worm.</p>
            <p>Every time you eat red apples you will grow longer.</p>
            <p>Avoid running into the walls or into yourself!</p>
			<p>Super stars will appear occasionally, collect them to shrink and score extra points, but watch out, they expire quickly!</p>
			<p>Watch out for black holes! Entering one will teleport the worm to the other side. They appear randomly and add a twist to your adventure! Hmm...perhaps you could use them to your advantage...</p>
            <p>After eating so many apples, the playing area will shrink: Easy Peasy-every 15, Worm Wriggler-every 10, Speedy Serpent-every 5</p>
            <p>Survive as long as you can and try to achieve the highest score!</p>
