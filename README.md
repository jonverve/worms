# Worm Game

## Description

Worm Game is a fun and interactive browser-based game. Players control a worm, navigating it around the screen to eat apples and avoid obstacles. The game features different difficulty levels, textures, and a dynamic playing area that shrinks over time.

One of my first programming experiences as a kid was Qbasic Nibbles, which was a Snake game clone. I have fond memories of hacking at the code and making improvements and learning the flow of software development, debugging, and adding features. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbles_(video_game)

## How to use

Just download all files into a single folder and open in web browser. As of v11, this was debugged and play-tested on PC with Chrome 122.0.6261.70 and Firefox 115.8.0.

## How to Play

* ⬇️ Use the arrow keys, WASD, or mouse click/hold to control the direction of the worm.
* 🍎 Every time you eat red apples you will grow longer.
* 💥 Avoid running into the walls or into yourself!
* ⭐ Super stars will appear occasionally, collect them to shrink and score extra points, but watch out, they expire quickly!
* 🕳️ Watch out for black holes! Entering one will teleport the worm to the other side. They appear randomly and add a twist to your adventure! Hmm...perhaps you could use them to your advantage...
* 💢 After eating so many apples, the playing area will shrink: Easy Peasy-every 15, Worm Wriggler and Speedy Serpend-every 10
* 💯 Survive as long as you can and try to achieve the highest score!
