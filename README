# How to Play

⬇️ Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the worm.
🍎 Every time you eat red apples you will grow longer.
💥 Avoid running into the walls or into yourself!
⭐ Super stars will appear occasionally, collect them to shrink and score extra points, but watch out, they expire quickly!
🕳️ Watch out for black holes! Entering one will teleport the worm to the other side. They appear randomly and add a twist to your adventure! Hmm...perhaps you could use them to your advantage...
💢 After eating so many apples, the playing area will shrink: Easy Peasy-every 15, Worm Wriggler-every 10, Speedy Serpent-every 5
💯 Survive as long as you can and try to achieve the highest score!
